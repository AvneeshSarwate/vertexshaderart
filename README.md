See it live at [vertexshaderart.com](http://vertexshaderart.com)

Cleary inspired by [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com) this one
only lets you edit a vertex shader. The vertex shaders main input is
just a `vertexId` that counts vertices.

## Why?

Because limits are AWESOME! Like 4k demos (or 1k) setting limits
almost always leads to more creativity.
